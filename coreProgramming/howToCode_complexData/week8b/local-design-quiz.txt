; Problem 1:
; 
; Suppose you have rosters for players on two opposing tennis teams, and each
; roster is ordered by team rank, with the best player listed first. When both 
; teams play, the best players of each team play one another,
; and the second-best players play one another, and so on down the line. When
; one team has more players than the other, the lowest ranking players on
; the larger team do not play.
; 
; Design a function that consumes two rosters, and produces true if all players 
; on both teams will play if the teams play each other. 
; No marks will be given to solution that do not use a cross product table. 
;
