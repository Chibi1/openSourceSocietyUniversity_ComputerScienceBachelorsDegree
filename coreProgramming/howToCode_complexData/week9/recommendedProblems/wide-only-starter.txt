; PROBLEM:
; 
; Use the built in version of filter to design a function called wide-only 
; that consumes a list of images and produces a list containing only those 
; images that are wider than they are tall.
; 


;; ListOfImage -> ListOfImage
;; produce a list of images that are wider than they are tall given a list of images
