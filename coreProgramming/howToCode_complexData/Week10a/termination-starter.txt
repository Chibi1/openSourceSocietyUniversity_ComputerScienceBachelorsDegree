PROBLEM:

Construct a three part termination argument for scarpet.

Base case: (= n 1)

Reduction step (next problem):

  if n is even     (/ n 2)
  if n is odd      (+ 1 (* n 3))

     
Argument that repeated application of reduction step will eventually 
reach the base case:

THIS IS A TRICK PROBLEM!
