; PROBLEM:
; 
; Using the following data definition, design a function that consumes a room and produces 
; the total number of rooms reachable from the given room. Include the starting room itself. 
; Your function should be tail recursive, but you should not use the primitive length function.
; 


;; Data Definitions: 

(define-struct room (name exits))
;; Room is (make-room String (listof Room))
;; interp. the room's name, and list of rooms that the exits lead to

; .
 
(define H1 (make-room "A" (list (make-room "B" empty))))

; .
 
(define H2 
  (shared ((-0- (make-room "A" (list (make-room "B" (list -0-))))))
    -0-)) 


; .

(define H3
  (shared ((-A- (make-room "A" (list -B-)))
           (-B- (make-room "B" (list -C-)))
           (-C- (make-room "C" (list -A-))))
    -A-))
           


; .

(define H4
  (shared ((-A- (make-room "A" (list -B- -D-)))
           (-B- (make-room "B" (list -C- -E-)))

           (-D- (make-room "D" (list -E-)))
           (-E- (make-room "E" (list -F- -A-)))
