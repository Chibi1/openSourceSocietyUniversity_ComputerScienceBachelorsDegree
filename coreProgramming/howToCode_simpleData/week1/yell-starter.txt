; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; DESIGN a function called yell that consumes strings like "hello" 
; and adds "!" to produce strings like "hello!".
; 
; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
; 
; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.
; 


;; String -> String
;; With given input string, add "!" to the end

(check-expect (exclaim "yes") "yes!")
(check-expect (exclaim "maybe") "maybe!")

;(define (exclaim str) "")    ; this is the stub

;(define (exclaim str)        ; this is the template
;  (... str))

(define (exclaim str)
  (string-append str "!"))
