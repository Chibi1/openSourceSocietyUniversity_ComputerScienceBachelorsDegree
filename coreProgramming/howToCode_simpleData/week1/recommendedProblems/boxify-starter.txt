; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes an image, 
; and appears to put a box around it. Note that you can do this by creating an "outline" 
; rectangle that is bigger than the image, and then using overlay to put it on top of the image. 
; For example:
; 
; (boxify (ellipse 60 30 "solid" "red")) should produce .
; 
; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
; 
; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.

;; Image -> Image
;; with given imput image produce the same image with a box outline of same width and height

(check-expect (boxify (ellipse 60 30 "solid" "red")) (overlay (rectangle 60 30 "outline" "black")
                                                              (ellipse 60 30 "solid" "red")))
(check-expect (boxify (ellipse 30 100 "solid" "orange")) (overlay (rectangle 30 100 "outline" "black")
                                                              (ellipse 30 100 "solid" "orange")))
